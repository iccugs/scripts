# Red Hat Developer VPS Trial w/root Access

This is a method that somebody posted on youtube to use the free Red Hat Openshift Developer Sandbox trial that comes with 32gb of ram and 8 cores to gain root access to their own VPS.


## Link to the Red Hat website for the free trial:

## Tutorial video with really bad music (not my video, this is simply where I found this method):
